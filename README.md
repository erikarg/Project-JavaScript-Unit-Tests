# Project JavaScript Unit Tests :test_tube:

Hi!

This is my javascript unit tests project, developed while studying the first module (web development fundamentals) at Trybe.

## Technologies

This project was developed using Jest(NodeJS) and JavaScript.

## Developed skills

- Practice on writing unit tests using NodeJS Jest module to verify the correct functioning of the functions;
- Practice on writing functions so that they meet already implemented tests;
- Practice on writing tests and functions skills through a test-driven development approach (TDD);
